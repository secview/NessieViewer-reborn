# Usage ?

Nessus viewer was originally used to quickly find information contained in a nessus or nmap report by sorting and filtering each entry. It is able to import entries from a nessus xmlV2 report and nmap xml report (-oA) and filter them by host IP, host name, plugin name, operating system, keywords ...
Try to double click on an IP to have a summary view of one host or generate clickable links to begin your tests.

Nessie Viewer Reborn is a simple standalone tool for windows that allows you to quickly sort, group and find flaws based on the output of multiple  scanning tools (Nmap xml, Nessus xml, Burp xml, ...).
